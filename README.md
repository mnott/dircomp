# dircomp

Recursively compare two directory trees.


# Overview

This script recursively compares two directory trees and prints the differences.

# Usage

Call the script with the --help as argument to get the help function:

```bash
$ dircomp.py --help
```

# Example

```bash
$ dircomp.py size /home/user1/Downloads /home/user2/Downloads
```

This will compare both directory tries based on their files' sizes.
